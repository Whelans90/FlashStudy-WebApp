# FlashStudy-WebApp
A flashcard web app. Was developed in Java using Spring MVC, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and HTML. Project was built on a local tomcat server. Along with building the web app we were also responsible for designing and building the DB. The project was completed over a two week period with a team of four. We also used a Trello Board to implement agile methods. The project was completed in two sprints, each a week long.

If you would like to see how the app works, besure to create a postgres DB. Then load in the schema.sql, data.sql, and user.sql. You will also need to run the app on a local server, as it is not currently being hosted.

Once the DB is built, you can access the app with the Username user1, and the password PasswordForFakeAccounts1. There is also the capability to register as a new user, and to create your own cards.
